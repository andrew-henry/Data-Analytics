Data Engineering Concepts
--

* Schema - 

* Distributed Systems - 

* Ralational Databases - 

* Ralational Database Management System (RDBMS) -

* Graph Databases - In computing, a graph database is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data. A key concept of the system is the graph. The graph relates the data items in the store to a collection of nodes and edges, the edges representing the relationships between the nodes.

* Data Warehouse

* Data Lake - is a system or repository of data stored in its natural/raw format, usually object blobs or files.
