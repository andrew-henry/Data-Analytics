Statistics
--

* Chi-Squared Test - The term "chi-squared test," also written as χ2 test, refers to certain types of statistical hypothesis tests that are valid to perform when the test statistic is chi-squared distributed under the null hypothesis. Often, however, the term is used to refer to Pearson's chi-squared test and variants thereof. Pearson's chi-squared test is used to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference (i.e., a magnitude of difference that is unlikely to be due to chance alone) between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more categories of a so-called contingency table.

* Anderson-Darling Test - The Anderson–Darling test is a statistical test of whether a given sample of data is drawn from a given probability distribution.

* Mann-Whitney U Test - also called the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon (MWW), Wilcoxon rank-sum test, or Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test) is a nonparametric test of the null hypothesis that it is equally likely that a randomly selected value from one population will be less than or greater than a randomly selected value from a second population

* Kendall’s Rank Correlation - is a statistic used to measure the ordinal association between two measured quantities. A τ test is a non-parametric hypothesis test for statistical dependence based on the τ coefficient.

Pandas

Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license.
